### GUI

BSP-3813 Develop a GUI client for client/server based refurbishing solution

### Used Versions

- Node.js version: v18.16.0
- npm version: 9.6.7

### Installation

1. Clone the Git repository to your local machine:

    `git clone <repository-url>`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    `cd project-name`

### Uage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Execute the following command to start the application:

- `npm start`

2. Open your web browser and access one of the following URLs:

- http://localhost:3000
- http://your-ip-address:3000

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. Lint errors will be displayed in the console.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
